# UNRVLD-Task

Hi Danielle, please find my code here and thank you for taking the time to review.

Ive done as much as I can and have a list of areas which need development.

### TODO for me and further development ideas:

- Filter sort list. Tying to work a solution currently
- - Add a search field to find beers
- Style the CTA grid further
- - Click a more info button on the CTA grid to show more beer data, possibly on its own page landing page to showcase the beer
- Animate the bottle icon to spin 90deg on click
- Add Jasmine testing to JS
- Review the async await call which i used to fix the accordion. Using setTimeout is not the best solution.

I really enjoyed doing this and I look forward to your feedback!

Many thanks, Alex Jefferis
