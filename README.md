# UNRVLD-Task

Hi Danielle, please find my code here and thank you for taking the time to review.

Ive done as much as I can and have a list of areas I am a bit stuck with.

### TODO for me:

* [] FIX ACCORDION - broken, since adding the API component. I think this is an async issue where the API is rendering the items the same time as the accordian JS.
* [] Animate the bottle icon to spin 90deg on click
* [] Filter sort list. Tying to work a solution currently
* [] Style the CTA grid further
* [] Set up Gulp to do CSS minify task and SASS. GULP is installed but not running yet. I have used VS code's plugin to compile my SASS up to this point.

I look forward to your feedback!

Many thanks, Alex Jefferis
